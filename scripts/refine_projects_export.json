In turn, this project will help with the initiation of the intended renewable energy programme of the Government of Botswana and to encourage the development of the private sector industry in the provision of renewable energy in the country.",

UNDP will assist the government in conducting at least one study visit to another GLOF risk reduction project in the Himalayan Karakorum Hindukush (HKH) region to ensure south-south transfer of technical know-how and experience. This will also be facilitated through global and regional research networks and centres working on GLOF issues. Additionally, other countries facing GLOF risks, such as China, India, Nepal and Bhutan, will also benefit from the knowledge generated through the project. This proposed initiative will contribute to a critical mass of experience on GLOF risks in the Himalaya region and enhance systematic regional cooperation on this critical adaptation issue.

The methods used in the process of developing the low carbon growth strategy can be replicated; the lessons learned from the project will be shared with neighbouring countries. In addition, the experience learned from this process will be transferable to other countries with similar level of economic development, in particular amongst middle-income developing countries.",
