Challenges identified include poverty within households preventing constructing of sanitation facilities; system for determining which households can qualify for sanitation assistance; communities not seeking out agencies' support for the construction of facilities; and lack of community capacity in conducting regular maintenance and monitoring of the systems.  Furthermore, hygiene education and related sanitation communication and awareness messages are implemented in an ad hoc manner especially in rural areas. The concept note proposes to expand implementation of the MAF CAP to include implementation of some of the solutions specifically those relating to Mayan and other ecologically vulnerable communities."

Good practices such as promoting vulnerable household participation in local development planning process, scaling-up climate change planning tools (i.e. vulnerability reduction assessment), adoption of resilient agriculture techniques, and promoting roles of different service providers in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction will be promoted. In addition, the project will enhance the government’s initiative to develop climate change mainstreaming guideline into sub-national planning. The guideline will contribute to government efforts on climate change financing at the sub-national levels."

            "description": "Mongolia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographical location, fragile ecosystem and socio-economic conditions. The combination of ongoing land and water degradation multiplied by climate change will almost certainly result in substantial ecological and social challenges. Integrated adaptation strategies and associated programs are necessary to maintain ecosystem functions and water provisioning services. If we do not implement climate change adaptation approaches immediately, vulnerability of Mongolia’s rural communities to impacts associated with ecosystem services will increase. Therefore, the maintenance of ecosystem functions and water provisioning services in critical water catchments is crucial for the survival of rural communities and the Mongolian economy. The project will apply the principles of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EBA) to increase climate change resilience at a landscape level. "

Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh Cities have attempted to properly identify those poor households: Ha Noi Department of Labour War Invalids and Social Affairs conducted ‘reviews’ of the list of poor households among the households with regular residence registrations  (KT1 and KT2) in concurrence to MOLISA guidelines and the city poverty line. In Ho Chi Minh City, attempts were made to capture not only household with regular residence, but also households with temporary residence registration (KT3). Nevertheless, none of these initiatives tried to identify seasonal workers (KT4) or simply unregistered short or long term migrants. "
