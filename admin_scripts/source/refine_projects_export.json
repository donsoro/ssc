The project goal is 'Sustainable Land Management provides the basis for economic development, food security and sustainable livelihoods while restoring the ecological integrity of the Kilimanjaro region's ecosystems'. The objective will be 'to provide land users and managers with the enabling environment (policy, financial, institutional, capacity) for SLM adoption. The outcomes are: 1) The policy, regulatory and institutional framework that support sustainable land management; 2) Markets support expansion of livelihood options in Kilimanjaro to reduce pressure on agriculture and natural resources and increase income: 3) Institutions with capacities and skills to undertake knowledge based sustainable land use planning and adopt methods and technologies for climate change resilient NR supported development: 4) Project managed effectively, lessons used to upscale SLM in the region and the country",

The project is expected to cost-effectively deliver an average 10% reduction in total residential and commercial energy use in partner countries at the time of peak impact by the year 2030 compared to a baseline scenario, thereby contributing to more environmentally sustainable and economically efficient development. BRESL will facilitate the transformation of the manufacture and sale of energy-efficient appliances and equipment through: 1) A regional initiative in Asia, with provision for general information, tools and training to all interested developing countries in the region plus customized efforts, all with a focus on regional cooperation; and, 2) National technical assistance to 5 developing countries in Asia. The project will focus largely on capacity building and assisting government, manufacturing, distributing, retail, consumer and environmental stakeholders throughout the Asian region to implement the most cost-effective energy efficiency measure available. In each participating country, priority activities will be carried out to help foster each country's preferred process for developing or expanding its ES&L program. Some of the participating countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam) have limited or no\rES&L programs and policies. This project will provide them with the information and assistance needed to develop and begin implementing such programs. Some of the participating countries (e.g., Thailand) have a number of ES&L programs and policies in place. This project will enable them to significantly expand their programs.

Facilitating regional cooperation will allow the participating countries to appreciate and gain from harmonization, or mutual recognition of energy performance test procedures. Initiating a dialogue between countries will help to lay the groundwork for eventual harmonization. The overall effect of this will be to increase the rate at which energy-efficient products are developed by local manufacturers and suppliers, recognized and supported by government policy, and purchased and used by consumers. All in all, this project will address these barriers through a combination of training and capacity-building, assessing and transmitting lessons learned, learning by doing, sharing work among countries to reduce the effort needed from each country, and technical assistance.
