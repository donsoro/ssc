The project is expected to cost-effectively deliver an average 10% reduction in total residential and commercial energy use in partner countries at the time of peak impact by the year 2030 compared to a baseline scenario, thereby contributing to more environmentally sustainable and economically efficient development. BRESL will facilitate the transformation of the manufacture and sale of energy-efficient appliances and equipment through- 1) A regional initiative in Asia, with provision for general information, tools and training to all interested developing countries in the region plus customized efforts, all with a focus on regional cooperation; and, 2) National technical assistance to 5 developing countries in Asia.
