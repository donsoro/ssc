Key Ministries (including the Ministries of Home and Foreign Affairs) participated in a National Consultation on human trafficking. The Consultation prioritized developing ongoing cooperation mechanisms between SAARC countries (IOM/UNHCR 2014). The Bangladesh Police will convene a SAARC meeting in 2015 to strengthen regional cooperation in human trafficking investigations and prosecutions. This will draw on lessons learnt from Philippines and Australia.
