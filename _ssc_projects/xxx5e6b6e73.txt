project_title: Sharing and Learning on Community Based Disaster Management in Asia (CBDM Asia)
scale: regional
project_objective: Asia is one of the most disaster-prone region. Regional coordination and cooperation in disaster management in Asia is still far from adequate. The CBDM Asia Project aims at improving knowledge management of disaster risk, promoting experience sharing among the participating countries, and providing a bridge for governments, academia, and communities to engage in dialogues and collaboration. Bangladesh and Nepal are engaged in the project as partner countries.

The project organized a mid-term review and an independent evaluation including assessment of reports and interviews with all stakeholders. Community-based disaster management approaches and increased engagement with China was seen as very relevant to all participating countries. Around a thousand individuals participated in project related consultations, meetings and workshops. Workshops were highly rated by participants and there is some evidence that learning is being put into practice.
