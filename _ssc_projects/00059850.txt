Following the development priorities identified through Community Based Organizations, the programme works closely with local governments to complete a number of community infrastructure projects, such as roads, health centres, kindergartens, community centres etc; (2) To help  vulnerable communities   access their rights, particularly access to public services –through civil registration, community policing, establishing and strengthening network of Roma mediators in areas of health education and child protection as well as  supporting vocational training and employment. 3- To promote policies and institutional strengthening for social inclusion of vulnerable communities through – capacity building and assistance to local and central government institutions and build capacities of Roma and Egyptian NGOs. In 2008 Albania joined the regional initiative 'Decade of Roma Inclusion' which aims to close the gap in welfare and living conditions between the Roma and non-Roma populations as well as putting an end to poverty and exclusion that many Roma find themselves in.  Based on that Albania developed a national Decade Action Plan that specifics the goals and indicators in the areas of education, employment, health and housing.

UNDP facilitated knowledge exchange and capacity building- (1) UNDP gathered experience on community development projects targeting Roma from Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Slovakia. Evaluations and methodologies from these experiences were used for implementation; (2) a field visit to Bulgaria, Croatia or Serbia (facilitated by UNDP COs) is planned  for representatives of the Technical Secretariat for Roma, representatives of the local government units benefiting from the project and project staff.  The aim of the study visit is to exchange experiences and become familiar with the approaches, strategies and methods used in other countries to tackle similar problems as they are part of the 'Decade of Roma Inclusion' initiative.  This was embedded as output 3.3.2.
