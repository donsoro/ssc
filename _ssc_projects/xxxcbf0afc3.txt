The South-South Cooperation is built through exchanging resources, sharing knowledge and technology amongst developing countries. ASEAN Foundation and UNDP selected 8 provinces as target areas. It is expected that pilot initiative will trigger more local government to play active roles and participate in South-South decentralized cooperation. The key outcome was the signing of two MoUs. The pilot led ASEAN Foundation to produce an option paper on South-South Cooperation within ASEAN.
