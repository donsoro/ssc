UNDP facilitated knowledge exchange between Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. The TPS is the first of its kind in Zimbabwe and the results will provide a more accurate representative data to determine the true TB disease burden in the country and it will be used to inform proper planning and programming. During the mid-term review, the WHO External reviewers applauded the survey team for a good work done.
