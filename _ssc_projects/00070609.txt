UNDP will provide support for capacity building. Its country offices in China and Cambodia will facilitate the training programme between the two governments and produce knowledge products. UNDP will also assist the Government of China in providing capacity development trainings to the Cambodian counterparts. China has signed two memoranda of understanding with Cambodia on Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) measures in Milled Rice and in Cassava. In addition, China and UNDP have signed an agreement on South -South Cooperation, and Cambodia is one of the first pilot countries for this trilateral pilot funded by China. In 2011, China financed a small agreement involving MAFF and UNDP, focusing on improving cassava cultivation methods and quality with small pilot groups of farmers. This also included training of MAFF extension officers in China on Cassava SPS conditions and methods to meet the requirement of the Chinese market. MAFF, the Ministry of Commerce of People's Republic of China (MOFCOM) and UNDP China have an on-going willingness to support cassava growers at farm level, to improve cultivation techniques. Additionally, UNDP Cambodia is to receive a grant (amount to be confirmed) under the Enhanced Integrated Framework (ElF) Programme to support the diversification of Cambodian export by increasing the number of export-ready processors of Cambodian cassava, and targeting new export markets.
