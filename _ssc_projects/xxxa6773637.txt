The partnership between the 2 countries resulted in the adoption by Swaziland of the SA Youth Innovation Hub model which is established at the University of Swaziland. UNDP provided the seed money for the establishment of the Youth Innovation Hub.  The GoS has commitment to actively involve the newly established IAS to lead in the implementation of the e-governance strategy.  The initiative has also provided impetus for the UNISWA to integrate innovation in the institution’s research agenda.
