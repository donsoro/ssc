UNDP facilitated knowlege exchange and capacity building trainings from 200 Civil Service Support Offices (CSSOs) drawn from Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda who engaged in strengthening South Sudanâ€™s civil service capacity. 34 CSSOs from Phase 1 of the project were deployed to GRSS institutions. Phase 2 of the initiative began in 2014 with recruitment of 139 CSSOs who will be deployed to South Sudan in 2015. As a result of the South-South learning, the GOSS is inthe process of developing  legal and regulatory frameworks to strengthen public administration, and to introduce a 2 year coaching and mentoring programme which aims to build the capacity of a minimum of 200 civil servants across various sectors.
