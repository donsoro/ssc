- In an effort to capitalize on regional and international expertise, UNDP organized capacity building using South-South cooperation agreements (in 2012, 150 training programmes and workshops were conducted in frameworks of NABD, of which 40 were abroad). Once an issue is identified for support through capacity assessment, exposure visits are organised as a mean to learn best practices and adapt them to the Afghan context.  Among them were the visits to the Philippines to study agriculture co-operatives, training in India for the Central Statistics Office and workshops on women participation in leadership and development in Turkey for the Gender Units of 15 Ministries. Additionally, 40 international and regional training programmes and exposure visits took place to leading institutions in Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyzstan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Turkey. They were carried out through South-South governmental collaboration agreements to support organizational capacity and aid policy development.
