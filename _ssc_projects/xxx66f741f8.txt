The initiative directly contributes to strengthening the market of EE lighting through increased capacities of the testing laboratories. The evidence of immediate relevance is the willingness of direct beneficiaries - Russian and Chinese laboratories to continue the collaboration through an adjusted approach to cross-testing. Indirect beneficiaries - the manufacturers and consumers of the EE light bulbs will potentially benefit from reduced access to market of low quality inefficient bulbs
