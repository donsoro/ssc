UNDP facilitated two South-South knowlege exchange visits for the Constitution Review Committee (CRC) of Liberia to Ghana and Kenya to learn about thier Constitution Review bodies.  The exchanges enhanced the capacity of the various institutions participating in thee study tours in affording exposure, forging partnerships, drawing lessons and learning best practices, with potential to be applied in Liberia. Since their return for example, the members of the CRC have spearheaded a public consultations exercise countrywide collecting views of citizens. The image of the police is changing as a result of exposure to client-oriented policing. Seventeen police officers (13 male and 4 female) were trained in Ghana for 8 weeks.  The initiatives enhanced the capacity of the CRC and the Liberia national police through the knowledge gained and partnership forged, learning best practices to be applied to the country’s development agenda.  As an end result of the exchanges the CRC was able to conclude public consultations in all 73 electoral districts reaching over 8,000 persons. It was also able to complete its report and framework for the national constitutional conference planned in 2015.
