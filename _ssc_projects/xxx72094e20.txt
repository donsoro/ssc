Bangladesh is finalizing its National Social Security Strategy. The Strategy provides a right-based life-cycle approach to social protection, reflecting the strategies and lessons from South Africa and Nepal (Draft NSSS 2014; SP in BGD 2014; SP Paper 2014). Bangladesh exchange visit participants played a leadership role in finalizing and generating national consensus on key Strategy elements (Minutes 2014).
