The initiative promotes knowledge exchange around the Ecovillage concept and results in Senegal in the operationalization of the concept (creation of a dedicated agency, 10 existing ecovillages) have inspired an exchange visit of Mauritania to Senegal. Furthermore, the Global Ecovillage Summit in Dakar in 2014 has provided an opportunity to further exchange between Senegal and other countries.
