UNDP facilitated knowledge exchange between Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the area of inclusive microfinance and a partnership with 18 financial service providers. The National Fund for Inclusive Finance has been able to carry out the implementation of the financial product “Access of the Poor to Financial Services” – that has provided access to more than 331.000 beneficiaries in 2014 with a total credit range of more than 9.7 billion FCFA, representing a performance rate of 110%. Exchanges have also allowed to agree on a study around SIG that will eventually allow to create the professional means for management, access and data collection.
