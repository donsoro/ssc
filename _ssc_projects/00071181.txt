UNDP will provide technical support in undertaking research that will inform policy development and review of various forms of social protection, and strengthen the institutional capacity of national government. In addition, exchanges with emerging economics and good practices will be organised to inform social protection schemes that also ensure employment creation and inclusive growth.
