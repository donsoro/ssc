project_title: "Moldova Energy and Biomass Project"
scale: national
project_objective: "The objective of the project is to contribute to a more secure, competitive and sustainable energy production in the Republic of Moldova through targeted support to the most viable and readily available local source of renewable energy, namely biomass from agricultural wastes. The project purpose is to increase the use of renewable energy technology significantly through fuel switching and energy efficiency. The project primarily focuses on improving heating comfort levels in rural public sector buildings including schools and community centres by using readily available waste straw supplied from local agricultural enterprises. The project will also stimulate local markets for improved household heating, industrial cogeneration, and biomass-based briquetting, as well as raise local capacity in the biomass sector, and promote the benefits of biomass energy and the project. The project consists of four inter-related outputs (work packages) as follows: 1: Municipal biomass heating and fuel supply markets established; 2: Foundations laid for establishment of efficient household heating, industrial cogeneration and biomass briquetting markets; 3: Capacity for local growth of biomass markets at regional and local levels is built; and 4: The opportunities and benefits of biomass energy for Moldova are well known locally, and visibility of project results promoted."
