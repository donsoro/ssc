The conference helped unifying operational procedures of witness support offices and  devising ways to strengthen institutional referral mechanisms relevant for systemic and long-term support to victims and witnesses. The findings also facilitated UNDPâ€™s continued support to relevant state and entity level institutions and partners in the process of forming efficient and functioning network of victim-witness support providers.
