project_objective: A delegation from UNDP Ivory Coast visited Rwanda in September 2014 to learn how to apply ICT innovations in their Police and GBV projects, by using mobile phone short text messages to address SGBV issues. Officials from the Government of Ivory Coast conducted a second exchange visit to Rwanda in November 2014 to share experiences on security policies, social cohesion and measuring performance in these areas, especially in terms of best practices and lessons learned from both countries.

The initiative benefited Ivory coast more but the Governance programme (the Access to Justice programme and the Rwanda National Police Project in particular) was used as a case study for learning purposes. In addition to this, it is worth noting that the Rwanda National Police has learned a lot from the exchange.  After the first learning visit, Ivory coast initiated SMS Polling (UN TEAMWORKS).
