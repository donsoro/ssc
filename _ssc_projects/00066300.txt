In this project, UNDP is to establish a regional information exchange and networking system in order to address barriers associated with incomplete knowledge and awareness related to legislative and policy options for HCTC phase-out and control.  Regional networking will assist participating countries (Belarus, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) in sharing their implementation experience, consistency and cross-border impacts related to HCFC control measures.  Additionally, networking and experience exchange will be promoted between countries to share their implementation experience, consistency and cross border impacts related to import/export issues and related enforcement. It is expected that one cross fertilization workshop will take place per year to allow for learning from each other's successes and challenges.
