Since a similar project has recently started in Russia, UNDP will facilitate the knowledge sharing and exchanges of ideas between 
Ukraine and Russia. By doing so, it is envisaged that common problems or mistakes can be shared and avoid being replicated by similar projects in neighbouring countries.
