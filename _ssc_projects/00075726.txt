UNDP manages and administrates the joint fund of this programme. Through the country offices of Uruguay and Mexico, UNDP provided technical, financial and operational support to the two governments. In 2013,  UNDP provided support to the governments of Mexico and Uruguay, represented by AUCI (Uruguayan Cooperation Agency) and AMEXCID (Mexican Cooperation Agency) for the launch of the first set of 10 innovative projects in the scientific field. All projects have an applicant organization (universities or institutions) from one country and a counterpart in the other; the interaction between them appears as an important synergy factor. These projects aim to be the first group in this innovative international cooperation and will set a good model to continue with newer initiatives.
