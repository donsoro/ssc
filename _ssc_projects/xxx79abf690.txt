project_title: Barrier removal to the cost effective development and implementation of energy efficiency standards and labeling project (BRESL)
scale: national
project_objective: To accelerate the adoption and implementation of energy standards and labels (ES&L) in Asia, and in so doing bring about energy savings from the use of energy efficient appliances/equipment. The project also facilitates harmonization of test procedures, standards and labels among developing countries in Asia, when appropriate. The project is expected to cost-effectively deliver an average 10% reduction in total residential and commercial energy use in partner countries at the time of peak impact by the year 2030 compared to a baseline scenario, thereby contributing to more environmentally sustainable and economically efficient development. BRESL will facilitate the transformation of the manufacture and sale of energy-efficient appliances and equipment through- 1) A regional initiative in Asia, with provision for general information, tools and training to all interested developing countries in the region plus customized efforts, all with a focus on regional cooperation; and, 2) National technical assistance to 5 developing countries in Asia. The project will focus largely on capacity building and assisting government, manufacturing, distributing, retail, consumer and environmental stakeholders throughout the Asian region to implement the most cost-effective energy efficiency measure available. In each participating country, priority activities will be carried out to help foster each country's preferred process for developing or expanding its ES&L program. Some of the participating countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam) have limited or no ES&L programs and policies. This project will provide them with the information and assistance needed to develop and begin implementing such programs. Some of the participating countries (e.g., Thailand) have a number of ES&L programs and policies in place. This project will enable them to significantly expand their programs. A few participating countries (e.g., China, Korea) have extensive ES&L programs. This project will enable them to update and expand their programs and will also use their expertise to help mentor other participating countries.

Through this regional programme, UNDP will focus on capacity building and information exchange, such a regional program will help to collectively eliminate ineffective practices, reduce financial barriers, and strengthen both policy formulation and enforcement. The technical exchange that is envisioned to happen under such a regional initiative will allow for information and expertise to flow more freely across borders within the region. Facilitating regional cooperation will allow the participating countries to appreciate and gain from harmonization, or mutual recognition of energy performance test procedures. Initiating a dialogue between countries will help to lay the groundwork for eventual harmonization. The overall effect of this will be to increase the rate at which energy-efficient products are developed by local manufacturers and suppliers, recognized and supported by government policy, and purchased and used by consumers. All in all, this project will address these barriers through a combination of training and capacity-building, assessing and transmitting lessons learned, learning by doing, sharing work among countries to reduce the effort needed from each country, and technical assistance. The participating countries include Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam.
