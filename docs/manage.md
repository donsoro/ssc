# Managing projects data

The information about each of the projects in the SSC database can be managed through a web-based interface. Any change to the data is reflected on the public site with no additional steps needed.  

## Management features

An administrator or manager can 

1. Edit existing SSC project information
1. Add new projects to SSC from http://open.undp.org

These features can be [accessed here](http://www.undp-ssc-mapping.org/#manage)

## Get started

Users are managed by administrators of the UNDP Github account. Any user wanting to edit the data will need to [create a Github account](https://github.com/join), and request to be added to the SSC repository as a contributor with write access.

## Editing data

All done through [Prose.io](http://prose.io). The simplest way to view the list of SSC projects is [here](http://prose.io/#undp/ssc). The [management pages](http://www.undp-ssc-mapping.org/#manage), described [below](#management-pages) give you more options for working with projects from the <http://open.undp.org> site.

If you have any problems accessing projects via Prose, make sure you have created a Github account, and asked the managers of the UNDP Github account to add you as a collaborator. You'll also find it easier to already be logged into to Github before you visit the Prose pages.

Each record has two parts: the ['description'](#editing-description), and the ['metadata'](#editing-metadata). You can use the icons on the right of the screen to move between editing each part:

### Editing description of SSC activity

This is the first page you see if you select a record.

### Editing metadata

Each project record contains many fields 

The Filters side panel on the main application

### Saving and publishing changes to the data

When you have made changes to either the description or the metadata, the save icon will have a coloured corner to show you need to save. 
![Save icon](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b7bts1dmdd1o95g/Screenshot%202015-05-06%2015.49.46.png?dl=1) 

Click the save button, and you will get a box asking for details of the change 
- you can enter any message you like in here, or leave the default text. 
![Commit message](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mn1qzhqcqubjx1t/Screenshot%202015-05-06%2015.50.55.png?dl=1)

Click the button marked `COMMIT` to save your changes.

You should be able to see your edits on the live site *almost* immediately. There is a small amount of processing required, so you may have to wait a minute or two.


## Management pages

There are 3 tabs, each containing a table with different data and functionality including projects from either the SSC database, or <http://open.undp.org> or both. 

![Management tabs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5sbu5mxa0p8v56/Screenshot%202015-05-06%2016.03.53.png?dl=1)

Each table has a search function, which searches the IDs and titles of every project.

![Searching management pages](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90fe4n5to7oq053/Screenshot%202015-05-06%2016.14.14.png?dl=1)

The column headings on each table give an indication of the functionality - usually clicking the ID (left column) creates or edits an SSC project, and clicking the project title takes you to a view page.

The tabs each have different uses, explained in detail below:

- [Possible to add](#possible-to-add) - a *filtered* list of projects from <http://open.undp.org> which *don't* already appear in the SSC projects database
- [Existing SSC](#existing-ssc) - all SSC projects
- [All open.undp.org](#all-httpopenundporg) - all projects from <http://open.undp.org>

### Possible to add

Likely to be the most useful - this list includes all projects from <http://open.undp.org>, and tries to remove those already in the SSC database. Click an ID in order to start creating a new record in the SSC database.

Example use case: a project included in 



### Existing SSC

Identical to the data visible on the SSC website, and via [Prose](http://prose.io/#undp/ssc). 

Example use case: review all 

### All <http://open.undp.org>
