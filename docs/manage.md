## Get started

Users are managed by administrators of the UNDP Github account. Any user wanting to edit the data will need to [create a Github account](https://github.com/join), and request to be added to the SSC repository as a contributor with write access.

## Editing data

All done through [Prose.io](http://prose.io). The simplest way to view the list, is view the [management pages](http://www.undp-ssc-mapping.org/#manage). You can also get to a [full list of all projects](http://prose.io/#undp/ssc).

If you have any problems accessing projects via Prose, make sure you have created a Github account, and asked the managers of the UNDP Github account to add you as a collaborator. You'll also find it easier to already be logged into to Github before you visit the Prose pages.

Each record has two parts: the ['description'](#editing-description), and the ['metadata'](#editing-metadata). You can use the icons on the right of the screen to move between editing each part:
