project_title: "Corporate Social Responsibility of Chinese Enterprises Overseas"
scale: national
project_objective: "To provide China's private sector the learning and leadership tools it needs to conduct its activities abroad responsibly. In 2013 the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) requested UNDP’s collaboration to advance the responsible business practices of China’s State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) by developing a framework to systemize current ad hoc CSR approaches to South-South cooperation, thereby promoting the sustainable development of Chinese enterprises abroad. The collaboration answers a call from Chinese business leaders for further policy and practical expertise on how to overcome the many challenges they face when operating in politically unstable countries that may lack basic physical and/or institutional infrastructure."

UNDP facilitates knowledge exchange and capacity building. In partnership with State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) and Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation (CAITEC), UNDP convened an international expert policy working group to provide policy options for an improved CSR framework, and to conduct extensive case studies to report on the state of CSR in Chinese SOEs operating abroad.
