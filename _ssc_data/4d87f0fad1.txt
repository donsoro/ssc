Facilitated by UNDP in Nepal’s Conflict Prevention Project (CPP) and its Timor-Leste counterpart, the Nepali team trained 28 officials of Timor-Leste’s Ministry of Social Solidarity on integrating conflict sensitivity, especially the “Do No Harm" approaches in development programming. UNDP facilitated study tours of Timor-Leste officials to Nepal to share their experience and knowledge on how to mainstream conflict sensitivity into all government ministries in both programming and policy works.
