UNDP facilitated partnership and knowledge sharing between China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam. UNDP also assisted in establishing a Regional Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling Network (REESLM) to help eliminate ineffective practices, reduce financial barriers, and strengthen both policy formulation and enforcement of energy standards and labels. The RESSLM network is seen as an important step forward towards reducing CO2 emissions in the region (facilitator of knowledge and partnerships)
