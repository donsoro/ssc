UNDP supported knowledge transfer (Argentina-Cuba). A Cuban expert participated in a workshop about the implementation of the “LEAP model” organized by the Bariloche Foundation in Argentina. As a result, the first Numerical Model of Weather and Climate in Cuba (“Modelación Numérica del Tiempo y el Clima en Cuba”) was organized.
