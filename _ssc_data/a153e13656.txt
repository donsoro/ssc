UNDP facilitates exchanges between Chile and Haiti, and administrates the programmeâ€™s funds. The Chilean government supports Haiti on housing through the implementation of a pilot project of sites and services. Following the UNDP-supported mission to El Salvador and Chile, a project was formulated and resources obtained (2MM USD) from the Government of Chile to replicate its experience in Haiti. Additionally, the Government of Haiti invested their own resources 3MM USD and an additional 4MM USD came from Jaloussie en Coleur. Also a Memorandum of Understanding to implement the Site and Services project was signed between the government of Chile, Haiti and UNDP.
