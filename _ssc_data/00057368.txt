In this project, UNDP will assist the Government of Montenegro in designing, establishing and financing a â€˜green business support programme' to support the establishment of biodiversity-friendly local entrepreneurial businesses. This activity will rely on the experience of the Croatian Coast project, which successfully runs a similar scheme.
