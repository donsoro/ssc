scale: national
project_objective: "To address the ODS focal area’s strategic programme, which is aimed at phasing out of HCFC (from production and consumption) and strengthening of capacities and institutions in participating countries. More specifically, this is in reference with the GEF Focal Area Strategy and Strategic Programming for GEF-4 document on Ozone (GEF/C, 31/10 May 11, 2007), which contains the following main objective: 
· For the period of GEF-4, the GEF will assist eligible countries in meeting their HCFC phase out 
obligations under the Montreal Protocol, and strengthening capacities and institutions in those countries 
that still are faced with difficulties in meeting their reporting obligations.

HCFCs and strengthening of capacities and institutions for GEF-4: 
· HCFCs are phased-out according to Montreal Protocol schedule, or faster, in GEF-eligible countries;

In this project, UNDP is to establish a regional information exchange and networking system in order to address barriers associated with incomplete knowledge and awareness related to legislative and policy options for HCTC phase-out and control. The regional networking will assist participating countries (Belarus, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) share implementation experience, consistency and cross-border impacts related to HCFC control measures. Additionally, the Networking will be implemented through exchanges between countries on implementation experience, consistency and cross border impacts related to import/export issues and related enforcement. It is expected that one cross fertilization workshop will take place per year which will allow for all participants to learn from successes and challenges in order to facilitate(facilitator role)
