UNDP supported creation and launch of the Youth-In portal, a Caribbean network for youth development, a new advocacy and knowledge sharing platform for the engagement of Caribbean youth in culture, community sports for social change, and arts, while facilitating youth networking and access to spaces and initiatives that will allow youth social and economic development. Youth networks have re-established and re-engaged to support national and regional development reform agendas through the work of the recently established Caribbean Youth Think Tank.
