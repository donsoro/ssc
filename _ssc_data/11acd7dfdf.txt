Support to different sector stakeholders from both countries in the identification of common interest development plans, such as the energy and the agriculture sectors, which have expansion and development plans within the watershed. As result of this support, bilateral agreements have been produced. As a result, bilateral dialogue and coordination between the Dominican Republic and Haiti authorities from the Ministries of Environment were strengthened.
