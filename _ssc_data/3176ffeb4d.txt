UNDP provided financing and technical assistance for the elaboration of the Colombian Low Carbon Development Strategy. The initiative is driven by South-South North NGO. Mitigation action plans on transport, waste, mining, energy, buildings/housing, industry and agriculture were developed and agreed upon. A methodology for analysing social, economic and environmental co-benefits of the actions included in the sectorial plans is under development and will be finished during the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, South-South-North has also promoted exchange of experiences between MAPS countries globally. Colombiaâ€™s input in this exchange has been fundamental as its strategy has been identified as one of the most advanced within developing countries.
