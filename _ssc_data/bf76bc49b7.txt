Brazil had entered into an agreement with the Government of Timor-Leste since 2002 to support the justice sector, and currently channels technical expertise through a Memorandum of Understanding with the UNDP Justice System Programme which enables the secondment of Brazilian judges, prosecutors, public defenders and administrative staff to the judiciary in Timor-Leste.
